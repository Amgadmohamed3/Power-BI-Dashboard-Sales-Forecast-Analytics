ðŸ“Š Orion Dashboard â€“ Power BI Sales & Forecast Analytics
ðŸ§  Project Story
  I built the Orion Dashboard in Power BI to analyze sales performance and compare actuals with forecasts across time, geography, and customer behavior. This one-page interactive dashboard was developed to help     sales teams and decision-makers quickly uncover trends, performance gaps, and customer insights.

ðŸ”§ Model & Data Preparation
  To start, I connected all relevant tables, ensuring accurate relationships were established despite different granularitiesâ€”especially between the Sales and Forecast tables. I created a robust Date table and      linked it to both fact tables to enable consistent time intelligence analysis.
  I also cleaned the Customer table, resolving data quality issues to ensure accurate mapping across regions and purchase behavior.

ðŸ“ˆ Analysis & Measures
Using DAX and Power BI modeling features, I implemented key analytical requirements:

  1-Total Sales ($): Displayed across multiple granularitiesâ€”year, product, geography.
  2-Year-over-Year Comparison (2008 vs. 2009): Built DAX measures to calculate sales delta.
  3-Top 10 Products: Highlighted their contribution to total sales using dynamic measures.
  4-Forecast vs. Actuals (2009): Directly compared performance using bar charts and KPIs.
  5-Top Customer Behavior: Tracked high-value customers and their product purchases across time.
  6-All analysis was made filterable by Country and State for tailored regional insights.

ðŸ“Š Visualization Design
This project was designed as a single-page dashboard, carefully laid out for clarity and quick decision-making:

  1-Bar and line charts to represent YoY comparisons and trends.
  2-Treemaps and pie charts for share analysis of top products.
  3-Tables and slicers for top customer drill-through.
  4-Added drill-downs, tooltips, and interactivity for deeper insights.
  5-All visuals are responsive and optimized for business storytelling.

ðŸ’¡ Final Outcome
  The Orion Dashboard enables the sales team to interactively explore sales dynamics, forecast accuracy, and top customer behavior with just a few clicksâ€”filtered by region or product. It serves as a clear,         functional, and actionable BI tool for business users.
